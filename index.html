    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A user-centric, dashboard-style "Tool Finder" SPA. The core is an interactive filter system (by Function, Price, Practice Type) that dynamically updates a grid of tool "cards". Clicking a card opens a modal with detailed information. This structure was chosen over a linear report format to empower users to quickly find relevant tools based on their immediate needs and budget, which is the primary goal for the target audience (early-career therapists). The design prioritizes task completion ("find a tool") over passive reading. It's supplemented by contextual sections for Key Insights (via an accordion) and a visual Price Analysis chart to make the report's data more digestible and actionable. The initial hero section now includes a brief introduction with interactive tooltips for key compliance terms, enhancing immediate user understanding. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Expanded list of therapist tools -> Goal: Find/Compare -> Viz/Method: Interactive Filterable Cards (HTML/JS/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Users click filters to narrow results instantly. Cards show key data; clicking reveals a detailed modal. -> Justification: Directly serves the user's primary goal of finding specific tools efficiently from a larger dataset.
        - Report Info: Pricing Tiers Analysis -> Goal: Compare price distribution -> Viz/Method: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips show the exact count of tools in each price bracket. -> Justification: Visually summarizes the expanded market landscape, making it easier to understand affordability trends.
        - Report Info: Key Considerations for Selection -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz/Method: Accordion (HTML/JS/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Users click to expand/collapse sections. -> Justification: Presents dense but crucial advisory content in a compact, manageable format, preventing information overload.
        - Report Info: Technical/Legal Terms (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) -> Goal: Explain -> Viz/Method: Inline text with JavaScript-powered Tooltips -> Interaction: Hover over terms to reveal definitions. -> Justification: Integrates crucial definitions directly into the introductory text, providing immediate clarification for non-technical users. -->

                When selecting digital tools for your therapy practice, your main focus should be on protecting your clients' sensitive information and maintaining their trust. This means understanding certain key terms related to data privacy. For instance, if you handle client health data, ensure your chosen technology complies with <span class="tooltip-trigger font-semibold text-teal-600 cursor-help" data-term="HIPAA">HIPAA</span> (for the U.S.), <span class="tooltip-trigger font-semibold text-teal-600 cursor-help" data-term="GDPR">GDPR</span> (for the EU/UK), or the <span class="tooltip-trigger font-semibold text-teal-600 cursor-help" data-term="DPDP Act">Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act)</span> (for India), and <span class="tooltip-trigger font-semibold text-teal-600 cursor-help" data-term="PIPEDA">PIPEDA</span> (for Canada), depending on where you and your clients are located. Look for vendors who are transparent about their <span class="tooltip-trigger font-semibold text-teal-600 cursor-help" data-term="SOC2">SOC2</span> compliance, indicating strong internal controls over data security. Always prioritize tools that offer a signed <span class="tooltip-trigger font-semibold text-teal-600 cursor-help" data-term="BAA">Business Associate Agreement (BAA)</span> if they handle <span class="tooltip-trigger font-semibold text-teal-600 cursor-help" data-term="PHI">Protected Health Information (PHI)</span>.
